Day #1  Date: June 14, 2025


-Created GitHub Repository

-Created a devoloper branch to be used for testing and practiced commands to do so,
now I have two branches (main, dev).


Day #2 Date: June 15, 2025


-Became way more comfortable with git commands

-Added a good amount of code to index.html which allows me to have a starting place for my app,

-I added a link to connect my style.css to my index.html and added a script.js to my html.

-I understand everything that is happening in the index.html except for 'div class', at this point
I assume that it is just creating a container to hold everything inside of it. Will research more to
get a better understanding.

-I added a few visible components to my page and created a test function to give an action to the button when clicked, currently when you click the 'Add Task' button it changes the background colour to light blue. Test Laptop Push
